### Meta-Data for Live Music
Working with semantic, linked data related to historical live music performances to remove technical and usability barriers towards accessing this information. To achieve this I am working with Python 3, Qt / PyQt, and the semantic querying language, SPARQL. This project is supervised by Sean Bechhofer.

### School of Computer Science Cataloguing System
A Node.JS based responsive website for staff and members of the University of Manchester to contribute information regarding valuable historical artefacts held within the school.

### EventLite
Working as part of a small team to create a event-management website using the Spring MVC framework. My role within the team was primarily writing functionality for the REST controllers and providing access through our web interface. I was also working on writing both unit and integration tests for this project.

### Trillary
Created as part of a short, one day Hackathon sponsored by Stanford University. Trillary is a web application supported by a Python back-end. Using a Gaussian Bayes Classification Model, it examined a user's tweets to classify linguistic similarity against those of the 2016 Presential Candidates (Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump).

### Stendhal
Working with an existing legacy code-base to both improve existing functionality and add new features to a multi-user MMORPG based on a client-server architecture. This was done as part of a small team, with the code-base consisting of approximately 6000 classes and having 1900 JUnit tests associated with it. We used Jenkins to assess our test coverage as well as Git for appropriate version control.
