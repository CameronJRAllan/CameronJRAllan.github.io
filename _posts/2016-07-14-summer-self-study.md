title: Summer Self-Study
---

Over the summer, between travelling across the Middle-East and working in Jordan, I decided to take up a regieme of self-study with the aims of:
Increasing my confidence with data structures, and applying them in my principal programming languages (Java, C and Python).
Preparing myself for 2nd year study at the University of Manchester, in subjects including Machine Learning, Networking and Operating Systems.
Begin preparing for internship oppertunities from September onwards.
