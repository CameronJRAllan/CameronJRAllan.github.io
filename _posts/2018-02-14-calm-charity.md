title: A Whirlwind Trip to London for Charity
---

Last weekend I had the pleasure of travelling on a whirl-wind trip to London to work with SpartaGlobal, IG, and CALM to help develop tools for reduce the impact of male suicide both in the United Kingdom and further abroad.

The tools developed analysed chat messages for particular sentiment (i.e. emotions), which could then be used to suggest resources appropriate, as well as alert particularly distressing messages to a representative when necessary. Our aim is to make this available to other charities in the future so that they may use them as part of their services.

I would like to thank all the companies involved, especially CALM for sending representatives from their charity for hosting me for the day, and I hope to continue this work to make a real impact in this area in the near future.
