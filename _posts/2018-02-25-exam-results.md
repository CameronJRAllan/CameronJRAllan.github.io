title: January Examination Result
---

A student's third and final year is often described with trepidation of expected examination results and mountains of forthcoming deadlines. I feel a significant amount of relief having received my January examination results, detailed below.

Agile Software Engineering: 84%
Cyptography and Network Security: 88%
User Experience: 90%
Managing Enterprise for Computer Scientists: 96%
