title: January Examination Results
---

A student's third and final year is often described with trepidation of expected examination results and mountains of forthcoming deadlines. I feel a significant amount of relief having received my January examination results, detailed below.  

Agile Software Engineering: 84%  
Cyptography and Network Security: 88%  
User Experience: 90%  
Managing Enterprise for Computer Scientists: 96%  

I can attribute this to following Matt Might's insight into suceeding at university: http://matt.might.net/articles/college-tips/
