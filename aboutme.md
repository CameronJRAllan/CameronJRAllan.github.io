My name is Cameron Allan, a Computer Science student at Manchester University, expecting to graduate with a MSc in 2019.

I take pride in developing my knowledge of Computer Science and software engineering wherever I can. This includes furthering my functional knowledge with regards to both theory as well as practical application with native programming languages.
