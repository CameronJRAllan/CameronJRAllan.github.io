My name is Cameron Allan, a Computer Science student at Manchester University, expecting to graduate with a first class BSc in 2018.

I take pride in developing my knowledge of Computer Science and software engineering wherever I can. This includes furthering my functional knowledge with regards to both theory as well as practical application with native programming languages.

My projects while at university have spanned both hardware and software, including developing fire-forest detectors which use micro-controllers and sensor arrays for detecting rapid changes in heat, to responsive websites for handling user input dynamically.
